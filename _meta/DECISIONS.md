# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) - ReviewAssist Pro

## ADR-001: Flask Framework Selection
**Date**: October 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need to choose backend framework for rapid development of review management SaaS platform.  
**Decision**: Use Flask 3.1.1 with SQLAlchemy ORM.  
**Rationale**: Flask provides flexibility for rapid prototyping, excellent ecosystem for AI integration (OpenAI), and straightforward WebSocket support via Flask-SocketIO. SQLAlchemy offers robust ORM capabilities for complex review data relationships.  
**Consequences**: Faster development cycle, easier AI integration, but requires more manual configuration compared to Django.

## ADR-002: Database Strategy
**Date**: October 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need database solution supporting development speed and production scalability.  
**Decision**: SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production.  
**Rationale**: SQLite enables rapid development without setup overhead. PostgreSQL provides production-grade performance, JSON support for flexible review data, and excellent Flask-SQLAlchemy compatibility.  
**Consequences**: Smooth development experience, but requires migration strategy for production deployment.

## ADR-003: Real-time Architecture
**Date**: October 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need real-time notifications and live dashboard updates for review management.  
**Decision**: Flask-SocketIO with Redis backend for WebSocket communication.  
**Rationale**: Flask-SocketIO integrates seamlessly with Flask application, Redis provides reliable message broadcasting, and WebSocket enables true real-time user experience.  
**Consequences**: Enhanced user experience with live updates, but adds infrastructure complexity with Redis dependency.

## ADR-004: Frontend Architecture
**Date**: October 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need responsive, interactive frontend for review management dashboard.  
**Decision**: Vanilla JavaScript SPA with Tailwind CSS, served as static files from Flask.  
**Rationale**: Vanilla JS reduces build complexity and dependencies, Tailwind CSS provides rapid styling, and static file serving simplifies deployment. Chart.js handles data visualization needs.  
**Consequences**: Faster development and deployment, but may require refactoring for complex UI interactions in future.

## ADR-005: Authentication Strategy
**Date**: October 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need secure authentication supporting multiple user roles and API access.  
**Decision**: JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.  
**Rationale**: JWT tokens enable stateless authentication, support API access, and integrate well with WebSocket authentication. Role-based system supports different user types (Admin/Manager/Agent).  
**Consequences**: Secure and scalable authentication, but requires careful token management and refresh strategies.

## ADR-006: AI Integration Approach
**Date**: October 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need AI-powered review response generation with quality and cost control.  
**Decision**: OpenAI API integration with GPT-3.5/GPT-4 models.  
**Rationale**: OpenAI provides high-quality response generation, well-documented API, and flexible model selection. Direct API integration allows cost control and response customization.  
**Consequences**: High-quality AI responses with manageable costs, but creates dependency on external service.

## ADR-007: Containerization Strategy
**Date**: October 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need consistent deployment across development and production environments.  
**Decision**: Docker containerization with Docker Compose for development.  
**Rationale**: Docker ensures environment consistency, simplifies deployment across platforms, and Docker Compose enables easy multi-service development setup.  
**Consequences**: Consistent deployments and easier scaling, but adds containerization learning curve.

## ADR-008: CI/CD Pipeline
**Date**: October 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need automated testing and deployment pipeline for code quality and reliability.  
**Decision**: GitHub Actions for CI/CD with multi-version Python testing.  
**Rationale**: GitHub Actions integrates directly with repository, supports matrix testing across Python versions, and provides free tier for open source projects.  
**Consequences**: Automated quality assurance and deployment, but requires GitHub dependency for CI/CD.

## ADR-009: Subscription Management
**Date**: October 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need flexible subscription billing for SaaS business model.  
**Decision**: Stripe integration for payment processing with custom subscription models.  
**Rationale**: Stripe provides comprehensive payment infrastructure, excellent documentation, webhook support for real-time updates, and handles PCI compliance.  
**Consequences**: Professional payment processing with reduced compliance burden, but adds external service dependency and transaction fees.

## ADR-010: Hosting Platform
**Date**: October 2025  
**Status**: Accepted  
**Context**: Need reliable hosting platform supporting Flask applications with database and Redis.  
**Decision**: Manus platform for initial deployment with multi-platform support.  
**Rationale**: Manus provides simple Flask deployment, built-in database support, and easy scaling. Docker support enables migration to other platforms (DigitalOcean, AWS, GCP) when needed.  
**Consequences**: Rapid deployment and scaling capabilities, with flexibility to migrate to other platforms as requirements evolve.
