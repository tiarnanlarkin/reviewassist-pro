## What Was Mapped from Existing Project

### Environment Variables
The existing `.env.example` was already comprehensive and includes all required variables:
- Core application secrets (SECRET_KEY, JWT_SECRET_KEY)
- Database and Redis connections
- OpenAI API integration
- Stripe payment processing (in development)
- SMTP configuration for notifications
- External API keys for review platforms

### Project Truth Extraction
- **Current Status**: Extracted from production deployment and development progress
- **Tech Stack**: Documented Flask 3.1.1, SQLAlchemy, WebSocket, and containerization setup
- **Features**: Mapped implemented features (authentication, real-time, analytics) and in-development items (Stripe integration)
- **Architecture**: Documented 10 major architectural decisions already made

| `scripts/gh_setup.sh` | ✅ | GitHub automation script |
| `branch_protection.json` | ✅ | Branch protection config |
| `.env.example` | ✅ | All required env vars |
| `/_meta/ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md` | ✅ | This document |

## Gaps to Confirm

### GitHub Workflows Permission
- **Issue**: Cannot add `.github/workflows/meta-guard.yml` due to GitHub App workflow permissions
- **Resolution**: Owner needs to manually add workflow file after enabling Actions
- **Impact**: Meta validation will not run automatically until workflow is added

### Admin Setup Required
- **Actions**: GitHub Actions not yet enabled
- **Branch Protection**: Not yet configured
- **Secrets**: Repository secrets not yet set
- **Resolution**: Owner to run `bash scripts/gh_setup.sh` and configure secrets

## Next 5 Tasks with Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Enable GitHub Actions and Add Meta Guard Workflow
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] GitHub Actions enabled in repository settings
- [ ] `meta-guard.yml` workflow file added to `.github/workflows/`
- [ ] Workflow runs successfully on test PR
- [ ] Meta validation enforces `_meta/TASKS.md` and `_meta/DECISIONS.md` updates

### 2. Configure Repository Security and Branch Protection
**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Branch protection rules applied to main branch
- [ ] Required status checks configured
- [ ] Code review requirements enforced
- [ ] Merge restrictions properly set

### 3. Set Up Repository Secrets and Environment Variables

## Implementation Quality

### Strengths
- **Zero Breaking Changes**: All existing application functionality preserved
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: All required files created with detailed content
- **Project Truth Accuracy**: Documentation reflects actual current state
- **Developer Experience**: Clear onboarding and development guidelines

### Technical Excellence
- **Architectural Decisions**: 10 ADRs document major technical choices
