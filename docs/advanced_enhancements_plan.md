## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Enhancements

### Database Schema Extensions
```sql
-- Users and Authentication
users (id, email, password_hash, role, created_at, updated_at)
user_sessions (id, user_id, token, expires_at)
organizations (id, name, settings, created_at)
user_organizations (user_id, organization_id, role)

-- Real-time Features
notifications (id, user_id, type, message, read, created_at)
activity_logs (id, user_id, action, details, timestamp)

-- Advanced Analytics
analytics_snapshots (id, date, metrics_json, created_at)
performance_metrics (id, user_id, metric_type, value, date)

-- Automation
automation_rules (id, name, conditions, actions, active, created_at)
scheduled_tasks (id, task_type, schedule, parameters, last_run)
```

### New API Endpoints
